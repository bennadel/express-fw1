# Express.js Learning Experiment -- Porting FW/1 Ideas

by [Ben Nadel][1] (on [Google+][2])

I've spent about a week and half diving into Express.js - one of the more popular Node.js
web application frameworks. Of that time, about a week has been spent just trying to 
understand the concept of Middleware, which has many subtleties like arbitrary nesting. 
To continue picking apart middleware functionality, I thought I would try to build a FW/1
(Framework One) inspired flow-of-control middleware on top of the Express.js routing 
system.
